    <h3>Joint learning of object and action detectors</h3>
    <p>While most existing approaches for detection in videos focus on objects or human actions separately, we aim at jointly
        detecting objects performing actions, such as cat eating or dog jumping. We introduce an end-to-end mul…</p>

    <h3>LSTM: A Search Space Odyssey</h3>
    <p>Several variants of the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture for recurrent neural networks have been proposed since
        its inception in 1995. In recent years, these networks have become the state-of-the-art models f…</p>

    <h3>ORB-SLAM2: An Open-Source SLAM System for Monocular, Stereo, and RGB-D Cameras</h3>
    <p>We present ORB-SLAM2, a complete simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system for monocular, stereo and RGB-D
        cameras, including map reuse, loop closing, and relocalization capabilities. The system work…</p>

    <h3>Low Correlation Sequences From Linear Combinations of Characters</h3>
    <p>Pairs of binary sequences formed using linear combinations of multiplicative characters of finite fields are exhibited
        that, when compared with a random sequence pairs, simultaneously achieve significantly lower mean square aut…</p>
